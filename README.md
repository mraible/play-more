Welcome to Play More!
=====================

I created this application because I wanted to see if I could create a fitness tracker with HTML5. I've used native apps RunKeeper and iWander, but I wanted to see if I could build a webapp with the same capabilities. I'd like to be able to click "Start" and have my time and distance tracked, as well as some good tunes flowing to my ears.

If you'd like to hear more about how I built this app, please [view HTML5 with Play/Scala, CoffeeScript and Jade from ÜberConf 2012](http://www.slideshare.net/mraible/html5-with-play-scala-coffeescript-and-jade-uberconf-2012 "Slideshare Presentation"), [watch the video from Devoxx 2011](http://www.devoxx.com/display/DV11/HTML5+with+Play+Scala%2C+CoffeeScript+and+Jade title="Video Footage from Devoxx") or [read my articles](http://raibledesigns.com/rd/tags/play-more) about building it.
